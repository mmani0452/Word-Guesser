# Word-Guesser
Word-Guesser is a word transformation and guessing game developed in Java.
This program was made using Java. The UI was created using JavaFX and also contains TCP networking. Clients playing the game must connect to the server before playing on their designated thread.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have maven Java JDK(version 8 or higher) downloaded.

### Steps:

1. **Clone The Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd path-to-repository/Word-Guesser
2. **Compile and run the program**:
   First, in the server program, run the command 'mvn clean compile exec:java'. Then in the client program, run the same command.
   From there when the UI asks for a port number type in '5555' and begin playing the game. Rules will be introduced once the client has connected to the server.
